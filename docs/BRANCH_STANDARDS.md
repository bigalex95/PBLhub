## 📁 Project Organization

### Naming Convention
```
##-descriptive-name/
```
- Use 2-digit numbering (01, 02, 03...)
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Descriptive but concise names
- Avoid abbreviations

### Project Structure
```
project-name/
├── README.md          # Project documentation (required)
├── src/              # Source code
├── tests/            # Unit tests
├── docs/             # Additional documentation
├── examples/         # Usage examples
├── requirements.txt   # Dependencies (Python)
├── CMakeLists.txt    # Build config (C++)
└── build/            # Build artifacts (gitignored)
```

### Project README Requirements
- Follow PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md structure
- Include all mandatory sections
- Provide complete build/run instructions
- Document lessons learned

---

## 🔄 Progress Tracking

### Status Indicators
- ⏳ **Planned** - Project defined but not started
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Currently working on
- ✅ **Completed** - Finished and documented
- ⏸️ **Paused** - Temporarily stopped
- ❌ **Cancelled** - No longer pursuing

### Difficulty Levels
- 🟢 **Beginner** - Basic concepts, simple implementation
- 🟡 **Intermediate** - Multiple concepts, moderate complexity
- 🔴 **Advanced** - Complex algorithms, system design
- 🔴 **Expert** - Cutting-edge techniques, optimization

### Progress Updates
- Update progress table after each project
- Maintain current focus and next milestone
- Update main branch progress tracker

---

## 🛠️ Tool Requirements

### Build/Setup Scripts
Each branch should provide:
- **setup-env.sh** (or equivalent) - Environment setup
- **build-all.sh** (or equivalent) - Build all projects
- **run-tests.sh** (or equivalent) - Run all tests

### Script Standards
- Include error handling (`set -e`)
- Provide clear output messages
- Check prerequisites before running
- Include usage instructions in comments

---

## 📚 Resource Organization

### Learning Notes (resources/learning-notes.md)
- Personal insights and challenges
- Key concepts with explanations
- Useful code snippets
- Questions and research topics

### Dependencies
- **Python**: requirements.txt with common packages
- **C++**: Document required libraries and versions
- **Other**: Technology-specific dependency management

---

## 🎯 Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Include meaningful comments
- Use consistent formatting
- Implement error handling

### Documentation Quality
- Clear and comprehensive
- Include examples
- Keep up-to-date with code changes
- Write for future self

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for workflows
- Error case testing
- Document test coverage

---

## 🔄 Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Updates
- **After each project**: Update progress tracker
- **Monthly**: Review and improve documentation
- **Quarterly**: Assess and refactor project organization

### Branch Health Checks
- Ensure all projects have complete documentation
- Verify build/run instructions are accurate
- Check that progress tracking is current
- Maintain consistent formatting

---

## 📊 Branch Metrics

### Success Indicators
- All projects have complete documentation
- Build/run instructions work correctly
- Progress tracker is accurate and current
- Learning objectives are being met

### Quality Metrics
- Documentation coverage: 100%
- Working build instructions: 100%
- Test coverage: >80% (where applicable)
- Code quality: Follows established standards

## 🚀 New Branch Creation

### Setup Checklist
When creating a new technology branch:

- [ ] Create branch from main
- [ ] Set up directory structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Add learning-notes.md template
- [ ] Create setup/build scripts
- [ ] Define project roadmap (8-12 projects)
- [ ] Update main branch with new technology
- [ ] Add navigation links

### Integration Requirements
- Update main README with new branch
- Add to CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- Ensure consistent formatting and standards
- Test all setup and build procedures
