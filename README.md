# 🚀 Project-Based Learning Hub

> **"Learning by building, not just reading"**

This repository is my personal **Project-Based Learning (PBL) hub** where I master technologies through hands-on projects rather than theoretical study. Each branch represents a focused learning journey with progressively challenging projects.

## 📊 Learning Progress Overview

| Technology | Projects Completed | Current Focus          | Skill Level |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| **C++**    | 0/10               | Setting up environment | 🌱 Beginner |
| **Python** | 0/8                | Planning first project | 🌱 Beginner |

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

- **Project-First Approach**: Every concept is learned through building something real
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Projects increase in complexity as skills develop
- **Documentation-Driven**: Each project thoroughly documented for future reference
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on understanding, not just completion
