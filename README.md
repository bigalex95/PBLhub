# � C++ Learning Journey

> **"Mastering modern C++ through hands-on projects"**

Welcome to my C++ learning branch! This is where I build my understanding of modern C++ (C++17/20) through progressively challenging projects, focusing on practical applications and best practices.

**Progress**: 0/11 projects completed
**Current Focus**: Setting up development environment
**Next Milestone**: Complete first 3 beginner projects

### 🎥 Project Highlight: Screen Recorder

**Project 11** focuses on building a **lightweight screen recording application** that captures desktop activity and saves it to video files. This project will explore:

- **System APIs**: Working with platform-specific screen capture APIs
- **Multimedia Processing**: Understanding video encoding and file formats
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient memory management for real-time capture
- **Optional GUI**: Simple interface for easy recording control
- **Cross-platform Design**: Supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS

The goal is to create a **minimal, fast, and user-friendly** screen recorder - perfect for quick demonstrations, tutorials, or capturing important screen activity.

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Required Tools

- **Compiler**: GCC 11+ or Clang 12+ (C++17/20 support)
- **Build System**: CMake 3.20+
- **Package Manager**: vcpkg or Conan
- **IDE/Editor**: VS Code with C++ extensions or CLion
- **Debugger**: GDB or LLDB
- **Version Control**: Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Compiler and Tools**:

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake git

   # macOS (with Homebrew)
   brew install cmake gcc

   # Windows (with vcpkg)
   # Follow vcpkg installation guide
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:

   ```bash
   g++ --version    # Should show GCC 11+
   cmake --version  # Should show CMake 3.20+
   ```

3. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bigalex95/PBLhub.git
   cd PBLhub
   git checkout cpp
   ```
